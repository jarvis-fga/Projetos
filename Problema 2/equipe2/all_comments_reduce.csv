review long overdue since consider A Tale Two Sisters single greatest film ever made  	1
I'll put gem against any movie terms screenplay cinematography acting post-production editing directing or any other aspect film-making  	1
practically perfect them true masterpiece sea faux masterpieces  	1
structure film easily tightly constructed history cinema  	1
can think no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
In other words content level film enough easily fill dozen other films  	1
How can anyone their right mind ask anything more from movie this?  	1
quite simply highest superlative form cinema imaginable  	1
Yes film does require rather significant amount puzzle-solving but pieces fit together create beautiful picture  	1
short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
Graphics far from best part game  	0
number best TH game series  	1
deserves strong love  	1
an insane game  	1
There massive levels massive unlockable characters just massive game  	1
Waste your money game  	1

Buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
PURE BRILLIANCE  	1
was flick doomed from its conception  	0
idea lame take minor character from mediocre PG-13 film make complete non-sequel while changing its tone PG-rated family movie  	0
wasn't least bit interested  	0
Not only only confirm  film would unfunny generic but also managed give away ENTIRE movie; not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke told trailer  	0
But just not funny  	0
But even talented Carrell can't save  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill Ed Helms just wasted  	0
story itself just predictable lazy  	0
only real effects work presence animals integration those scenes some worst obvious blue green-screen work I've ever seen  	0
But whatever  cost them so much didn't translate quality 's sure  	0
film succeeds despite or perhaps because obviously meagre budget  	1
I'm glad film didn't obvious choice lesser film certainly would  	1
In addition having lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts cutest leading ladies ever grace screen  	1
hard not fall head-over-heels love  girl  	1

disappointed movie  	0
One character totally annoying voice  gives feeling fingernails chalkboard  	0
There totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene  	0
There absolutely no warmth or charm scenes or characters  	0
movie totally grates nerves  	0
performances not improved by improvisation because actors now twice much worry about: not only whether they're delivering line well but whether line itself any good  	0
And quite honestly often its not good  	0
Often dialogue doesn't really follow from line another or fit surroundings  	0
crackles unpredictable youthful energy but honestly found hard follow concentrate meanders so badly  	0
There some generally great things it  	1
wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours your time though  	0
suspense builders were good & just cross line from G PG  	1
especially liked non-cliche choices parents; other movies could predict dialog verbatim but writing movie made better selections  	1
If want movie 's not gross but gives some chills great choice  	1
Alexander Nevsky great film  	1
He amazing film artist important whoever lived  	1
I'm glad pretentious piece s*** didn't do planned by Dodge stratus Big Shots gonna help movie makers aren't restrained movie businessof Qu√©bec  	0

MANNA FROM HEAVEN terrific film  both predictable unpredictable same time  	1
scenes often funny occasionally touching characters evaluate their lives where they going  	1
cast veteran actors more just nostalgia trip  	1
Ursula Burton's portrayal nun both touching funny same time making fun nuns or church  	1
If looking movie terrific cast some good music(including Shirley Jones rendition Way Look Tonight) uplifting ending give try  	1
don't think will disappointed  	1

NOBODY identifies characters because they're cardboard cutouts stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes)  	0
bad film bad writing good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis people can't handle anything but bold strokes storytellinga picture painted crayons  	0
Crash depressing little nothing  provokes emotion but teaches nothing if already know racism prejudice bad things  	0
Still do like movie empowerment women; there's not enough movies like  	1
Your brain will attempt shut-down part primal impulse self-preservation  	0

Utterly without merit any level akin torture  	0
I'll even say again ¬ñ torture  	0
Maybe would reasonable explanation atrocity  	0
Not pleasant voyage self-discovery  	0
Highly unrecommended  	0
If premise sound stupid 's because  	0
Yes  bad  	0
Nothing recommend  	0
An excellent performance from Ms  	1
Garbo showed right bat  her talents could carry over from silent era (I wanted see some her silent work but Netflix doesn't seem stocking them  	1
also great see  renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed step going from silent sound  	1
movie suffered because writing needed more suspense  	0
There were many close ups  	0
But other  movie seemed drag heroes didn't really work their freedom  	0
But movie definitely below average rent  	0
You'll love it   	1
movie BAD  	0
So bad  	0
film way long  	0
definitely bad ones  	0
movie received great quality film age  	1
John Wayne incredible job being so young movie industry  	1
His screen presence shined thought even though were other senior actors screen 	1
think  must see older John Wayne film  	1
really don't see anyone could enjoy movie  	0
don't think I've ever seen movie half boring self-indulgent piece junk  	0
probably would been better if director hadn't spent movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't  noteworthy  	0
Another thing didn't really like character got punched face gallon blood would spew forth soon after  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely Ray Charles  	1
His performance simply genius  	1
He owns film just Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughterand Quaid owned Great Balls Fire  	1
In fact hard remember  part Ray Charles being acted not played by man himself  	1
Ray Charles legendary  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material film which goes well beyond being just another movie musician  	1
Hitchcock great director  	1
Ironically mostly find his films total waste time watch  	0
Secondly Hitchcock pretty much perfected thriller chase movie  	1
pandering audience  sabotages his films  	0
Hence whole story lacks certain energy  	0
plot simply rumbles like machine desperately depending addition new scenes  	0
There usual Hitchcock logic flaws  	0
Mishima extremely uninteresting  	0
chilly unremarkable movie author living working chilly abstruse culture  	0
flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they emotionally adrift stagy  	0
And rest just sits being awful soldiers singing songs masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting purity admiration swords etc  	0
He can bore pieces kill momentum movie quicker anyone else  	0
Schrader made resume full lousy amateurish films  	0
When first watched movie 80s loved it  	1
totally fascinated by music dancing everything  	1
However recently watched whole thing again DVD completely struck by extremely stupid storyline contained holes inconsistencies frankly whole lot crap horrid dancing  	0
mean realistic world would NEVER gotten  ballet repertory whole thing quite pathetic  	0
character developments also lacked depth  	0
Woa talk awful  	0
Do not waste your time  	0
was just horrible  	0
worst sappiest dialogue could on  	0
But what really made unwatchable direction  	0
poor actors  	0
can't even tell if they any talent because they not only pathetic lines speak but director gave them no action  	0
If check director's filmography site will see why film didn't chance  	0
would not even good made TV flick  	0
If good intentions made film great film might greatest films ever made  	1
film great actors master director significant theme--at least would-be significant theme undertone fifties existential world-weariness aerial scenes  ought thrilled both senses imagination characters which might deeply care  	1
Regrettably film fails  	0
movie lacks visual interest drama expression feeling celebration patriotism  underlines narrative  	0
No actress been worse used  June Allison movie  	0

Overall movie cheap trash  	0
But movie not funny considering ridiculousness it  	0
came feeling angry  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) said it SURFACE superbly crafted  	1
cinematography simply stunning (to say least) fx nothing if not state-of-the-art  	1
Conceptually show offers little bit everythingjust everybody (parents kids fantasy and or fx fans)  	1
And wasn't single sour note struck acting-wise either; some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
All things considered job well done  	1
