the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no 	0
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0
i was very disappointed	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced	0
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive  twice and i thought it was average at best	0
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why	0
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu	0
the ambiance here did not  like a buffet  but more of a douchey indoor garden for  and 	0
con spotty service	0
the fries were not hot and neither was  burger	0
but then they came back cold	0
then our food came out disappointment ensued	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
 husband said  was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
the only reason to eat here would be to  up before a night of binge drinking just to get  carbs in your stomach	0

the ambiance isnt much better	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our 	0
the food wasnt good	0
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked	0
what happened next was prettyoff putting	0
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
overpriced for what you are getting	0
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
i kept  at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
i have  to very few places to eat that under no  would i ever return to and this  the list	0
we started with the  sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh	0
food was below average	0
it sure does beat the  at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant	0
all in all ha long  was a bit of a flop	0
the problem i have is that they charge $1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
it really is impressive that the place   down	0
i would avoid this place if you are  in the mirage	0
the refried beans that came with  meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
spend your money and time  place else	0
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in  	0
the  of the food was awful	0
i cant  you how disappointed i was	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
appetite instantly gone	0
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time	0
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of  life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the 	0
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man  	0
not sure who was more lost  the flat characters or the audience  half of whom walked out  	0
attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera  the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0
very little music or anything to speak of  	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps  through his head  	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty  	0
wasted two hours  	0
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids  	1
a bit predictable  	0
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very   	1
the  were the best and the muppets were so hilarious  	1
it was so cool  	1
this is a very "right on casemovie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
it had  average acting from the  person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
 put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
its  perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces  	1
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily  a  other films  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema   	1
 this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the   together to  a beautiful picture  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
this is the  one best th game in the series  	1
it deserves strong love  	1
it is an insane game  	1
there are massive  massive unlockable characters its just a massive game  	1
waste your money on this game  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye  	1
this game rocks  	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
its pure brilliance  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception  	0
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0
i wasnt the least bit interested  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the  movie; and im not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is  in the trailer  	0
but its just not funny  	0
but even the talented carrell cant save this  	0
his costars dont fare much better with people like  freeman  hill and ed helms just wasted  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
the only real effects work is the  of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is  of the worst and most  blue/greenscreen work ive ever seen  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure  	0
the film succeeds  or  because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
im glad the film didnt go for the most  choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
in  to having one of the most lovely  ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl  	1
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
but i recommend waiting for their  efforts let this one go  	0
excellent cast story line performances  	1
totally believable  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to  children when they were little  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	0
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene  	0
there was absolutely no  or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
this movie totally grates on  nerves  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre  the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
often the dialogue doesnt really  from one line to another or  the surroundings  	0
it crackles with an  youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to  and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	0
there are  generally great things in it  	1
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though  	0
the suspense builders were good & just cross the line from g to pg  	1
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents; in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you  chills this is a great choice  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
 is an amazing film artist one of t most important whoever   	1
im glad this pretentious piece of  didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained "movie businessof qu√©bec  	0
this if the first movie ive  a 10 to in years  	1
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
plus it was wellpaced and suited its  short run time  	1
give this one a look  	1
i  it a 10  	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
it is a true classic  	1
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horror/suspense films go  	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
the problem was the script  	0
it was horrendous  	0
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and  at the same time  	1
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip  	1
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out  fun of nuns or the church  	1
if you are  for a movie with a terrific cast  good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of "the way you look tonight" and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
i dont think you will be disappointed  	1
frankly after cotton  and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  	0
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	0
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
too politically correct  	0
very disappointing  	0
the only thing really worth  was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful  	1
i love lane but ive never seen  in a movie this lousy  	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and   	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have  played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good  	0
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper  of  never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0
the scenes with the "ohsomatureneighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was  for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
 applause should be  to the "preludehowever  	1
i really liked that  	1
a great film by a great director  	1
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
id  anyone to go and see it  	1
brilliant  	1
10/10  	1
i liked this movie way too much  	1
 only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low  michael ironside  	0
it rocked  world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a  boring movie  	0
tre was no  between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why  would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that  supposedly was knocked out by  	0
there were   in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
this was a poor remake of "my best  wedding"  	0
all in all a great disappointment  	0
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film"  	0
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq  	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
imdb  only go as low 1 for awful its time to get  negative numbers in there for cases  as these  	0
i saw "mirrormasklast night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of  tension or conflict  	0
these are the   of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination  	0
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	0
it is an hour and half waste of time  a bunch of very pretty  schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly  	0
the fish is badly made and  of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  	0
a truly truly bad film  	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
i paid too much  	0
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1
it was so boring  	0
no plot whatsoever  	0
again no plot at all  	0
horrible  	0
worst hour and a half of  lifeoh    	0
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get  relief  	0
i hate movies like that  	0
yeah the movie pretty much sucked  	0
there is no plot or storyline  	0
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
awful  	0
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	0
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid $750 to see this crap  	0
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard  and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon  by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the  strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know  and prejudice are bad things  	0
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women; theres not enough movies out there like this one  	1
your brain will  to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
i was left shattered from the experience of  this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
everything is appalling  	0
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the uglst     	0
the story is beyond stupid  	0
the script is¬Öwas there a script  	0
the kids are annoying  	0
the lead man is charismafree  	0
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
 even say it again  this is torture  	0
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
not a  voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
highly unrecommended  	0
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is  	0
 its that bad  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
an excellent performance from ms  	1
garbo who showed right off the bat that  talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see  of  silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them  	1
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion   a step going from silent to sound  	1
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
there were too many close ups  	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom  	0
but this movie is definitely a below average   	0
youll love it  	1
this movie is bad  	0
so bad  	0
the film is way too long  	0
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age  	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
his on screen  shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
i think that it is a must see  john wayne film  	1
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this  piece of junk  	0
it probably would have  better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that   	0
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of  would spew forth soon after  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
 owns t film just as spacek owned "coal miners daughterand quaid owned "great balls of fire  	1
in fact its hard to  that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
ray charles is legendary  	1
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
 the whole story lacks a certain energy  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the  of new scenes  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
the flat reenactments dont hold your  because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing  about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
 can bore you to  and kill t momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else  	0
 has made a resume  of lousy amateurish films  	0
when i first watched this movie in the  i loved it  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
i mean in a  world  would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
woa talk about awful  	0
do not waste your time  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
the poor actors  	0
you cant even  if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director  them no action  	0
if you  the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	0
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  	1
the film has great actors a  director a significant at least a wouldbe significant  undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both  and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
regrettably the film fails  	0
the movie lacks  interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
no actress has  worse used that  allison in this movie  	0
yet i enjoy  it  	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
the acting sucked  	0
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
that was nice  	1
that was funny  	1
it was so funny  	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	0
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
***spoilers*** whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly   	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody  kids fantasy and/or fx fans  	1
and there wasnt a single sour  struck actingwise either;  surprisingly solid casting here  	1
all things considered a job very well done  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
the   to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	1
up there with the best of melville  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
im not sure what  was trying to do with this film  	0
if it was to turn  good day feeling into a night of  memories than i guess  succeeded  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places  	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
again lame  	0
heres where the movie really pi**ed me off  	0
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
summary the witticisms werent   	0
the plot  well i said id let that one go  	0
the acting was bad  	0
really bad  	0
even  bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse  	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
rating 1 out of 10  	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
 is one of  favourite directors and one of t most talented directors in t history of cinema  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	1
three of the most   movies ive ever seen  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved t ending how all t characters of t three films were t  survivors of t ferry disaster with valentine and t young judge toget and t old man  it on  tv solidifying his happiness over t suffering which  dealt with for those many years  	1
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a  on  face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i recommend this for  who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i literally vomited while  this film  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
the story which was  so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years  really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in  5year working experience that i found offensive to  intelligence  	0
but when one strives for greatness and  but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that  other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap"  	0
to those who find this movie intelligent or even  i can only say  its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make  sense of this pitiful  its in our human  to try and make sense of things   	0
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic  character was just too much  	0
this is  a fun and funny movie  	1
highly entertaining at all   	1
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous  	1
it even has its sweet   	1
the  repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
all the characters in this film are  well played  	1
and i really did find them funny  	1
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
there is a brilliant  ending  	1
i love it  	1
the ending is so so perfect youll  a tear  	1
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this  	1
i will never  it now  	1
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic  	1
which has more depth and character than the man  it  	0
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
this movie is terrible  	0
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet  of the net etc  	0
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time  	0
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
started  this but didnt believe in any of the characters  	0
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all  	0
it was a very superficial movie and it  me the feeling that i was  play rather than a film  	0
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off  	0
glad i didnt pay to see it  	0
didnt  or even  once  	0
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn  	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
barney is definitely super de duper  	1
is pretty funny  	1
babie bop is very cute  	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
but "storm trooperis not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
its just lame  	0
the  who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie  	0
it is shameful  	0
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  	1
the writers were "smack onand i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself  them over and over again  	1
now you know why i  it a   	1
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories  	1
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows  strong sibling bond for each other  	1
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
this movie has a cutting edge to it  	1
i am so pleased to know  a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  	0
i felt as though  going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	0
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying  	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters  depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot  	0
i guess it was supposed to be clever  then   light on the  but it was just stupid  	0
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  	1
this was  an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
i really loved the story line and the poler  was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away  	1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at  watch about 70000 times  	0
 bell is so much hig than this crap and for  to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
all this movie does is make you sick  all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
i think the most wonderful parts literally  of "wonder" are the excerpts from his works  	1
the  especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  	1
the stories were powerful explorations of the  of man and of art  	1
after  this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	1
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art  theater politics or japanese history  	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age  	1
 what makes this story different are the terrific  values  faultless photography composition and editing  the terrific casting  the underappreciated  keith playing a bully teddy  and vivid history  	1
though the wind and the lion is   through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts "big stick"  	1
this is  adventure at its best  	1
i think it was robert  best film because  portrayed someone like  fatr and  was a schizophrenic in real life fatr although  never murdered anyone but was affected more so during t second world war which made him worse  	1
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	1
 mother and  had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
almost all of the  in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how  used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
the good cinematography also makes  and monica bellucci look very beautiful  	1
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1
for people who are first timers in film  i think they did an excellent job  	1
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i rather enjoyed it  	1
i liked it  	1
i couldnt take them seriously  	0
it really  a unique feeling though  	1
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
 role was played well  	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
the camera really likes  in this movie  	1
i would have casted  in that role after  the script  	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to  time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the  were slightly different  	1
i am a fan of his  this movie sucked really bad  	0
even worse than ticker  	0
& that movie was bad  	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe & poor hummh  	0
it just blew  	0
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is  under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on  20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel  the lid  	1
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it  outit has new features  	1
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant  propaganda  	0
this show is made for   it is too stupid and  with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere  	0
almost  involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all   	0
i wish i could  negative values admins  	0
the  are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  	0
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a  flakes box and a   that bordered on stupidity  	0
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
i hate writing bad  about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have   of it  	0
i am not a  nor am i a director but i would hide  head in the  if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	0
in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
1/10  and only because there is no  for 0/10  	0
an interesting premise and  drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side  id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones  	1
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either  	1
but the actingeven that of  professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse  contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
still it was the  that got a big "10on  "oyveyscale  	1
 i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
both do good  and are quite amusing  	1
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
i let  girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  	0
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
i like armand assante &  cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the    	1
 8/10 score is mostly for the plot  	1
i wont say any more  i dont like  so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  	1
wow what a bad film  	0
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible  	0
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
not even good for camp value  	0
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this  	0
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing   	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower  	0
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie  and was very disappointed  	0
i know  was a contract player with little control over his scripts but t acting was as bad as t script  	0
victor mclaglen was even bad and  donlevy was almost   	0
considering the  off screen between taylor and  it was  how little  there was on screen between the two of them  	0
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us  	0
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing  	0
whatever t producer was going for   entirely  	0
i was deeply impressed with t character  played  	1
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite  stoic emoting think  yun fat in a better tomorrow and  cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory  for a few poorly executed flying judo  a la john woo  	0
even the squibs look awful  	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
the plot  as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by  who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  	0
the directing is sloppy at best  	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
of course the acting is blah  	0
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a  and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve  great had it  handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its  of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but  god this was one of  best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened  eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before  	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110   	1
lifetime does not  it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
i particularly    being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the  to punish the unemployed for not having   	0
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will  it  	1
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
but this movie really got to me  	1
see it  	1
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own  kinda weird   	1
and i  t casting re i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in t role as t botrsome man who doesnt understand wre  is what  is  and why  	1
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	1
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
the  audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
i left the theater with a lilt in  step joy in   and hope for the human race  	1
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  	1
the rest of the cast also play well  	1
cinematography  including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
about  minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting  before a  script was completed  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
the cast is good  	1
for that its worth checking out  	1
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in   life  	0
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  	0
everything about it is just bad  	0
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention  season  	0
the script is bad very bad  it  both cheesiness and unethical joke that you  see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period  	0
final word this show is a real torture  	0
it is zillion times away from   	0
 washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
rating 0/10 grade z  the show is so bad that even mot of the cast pull   out of the show  	0
  foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  	0
 of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by  negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
from here on the widmark character  unintentionally comical  	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of   and indoor exteriors  	0
whatever prompted  a documentary is beyond me  	0
very serious  this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start  	0
the cast was great  	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper  uptight white   	1
 betty white and  smart and you have a great cast   played their parts really well  	1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend   	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character  	0
there is no real plot  	0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
this second appearance of mickey mouse  the silent plane crazy  that year is probably his most  filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
its just adorable seeing mickey playing "turkey in the strawin a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing  	0
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more  works of film out there  	0
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece  	1
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe  	1
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	0
this may be t only bad film  ever made  	0
so badwellits just bad  	0
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	0
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
i thought it was bad  	0
both films are terrible but to the  of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad  	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by  a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
director paul matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995  movie "grim" clearly doesnt know how to pace his films  	0
the movie is terribly boring in places  	0
the lighting is awful  	0
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of  gore  	0
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here  	0
the  effects were awful  	0
the cg   in space looked like it could have   on microsoft slideshow for gods sake  	0
the "explosionof the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
okay i like to consider myself a  critic so  give  where s duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool  	1
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling   	1
to sum the film up "breedersis a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
not recommended  	0
 is almost unbearable to watch on screen  has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing  	0
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted re too as  is at his most incendiary wn  is unrestrained which t pg13 rating certainly wont   	0
t films sole bright spot was  hill who will look almost  to fans of t recent superbad  to t amount of weight  lost in t interim  	1
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer  	0
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the  classic  	0
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
generally; it just lacked imagination  	0
not recommended  	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period  	0
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this  	0
which is precisely why i am giving it  a bad review  	0
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
but "tiny toonskept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever   	1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
easily none other cartoon made me  in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
every  of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
 lines seem to have  written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	0
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie  	0
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles  	0
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  	0
the story line is just awful  	0
its just painful  	0
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
dont waste your time  this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it  	1
go watch it  	1
omit  this  	0
very funny  	1
 rating just 3 out of 10  	0
the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	1
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
dont miss it  	1
this is a  piece of filmmaking with many  simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all  of the poets bohemian  wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love  to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
a  subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into   the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though  under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
but above all the exquisite  composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera  and lighting including pointillistic faux  movie footage is a  and joy to behold  	1
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more  than  of that masters work  	1
the  premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable  on the documentary crew  	0
regardless the film fails on most   	0
avoid at all costs  	0
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become  favourite actor  	1
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as  was  dads favourite actor and i grew up  his films as a child  	1
but it wasnt until i watcd this film that i realised how great  actually was  	1
 give this film 10 out of 10  	1
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
 really didnt seem to want to be hosting; his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with t guests  	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and  random taxidermists  	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy  but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original  	1
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable  	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and  the  as a typical sci fi film  	1
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver   	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch  	1
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
overall a delight  	1
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even    	0
the film lacks any real scares or tension &  of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
the least said about the acting the better  	0
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film  	1
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must  view or see  	1
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
excellent performance  	1
there still are good actors around  	1
also great directing and photography  	1
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans  	1
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe  the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	1
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes  just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in  taste for  and evil  	1
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1
this is a  and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly  of its academy award  	1
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral  in helping to make this  a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
however paul  has indeed made a film "aboutmishima that is both superb & complex  	1
also  is john baileys fine crisp beautifully  cinematography and the great  design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which  received a well deserved oscar  	1
even  for poor  values for the time 1971 and the format  kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
unless youre just out to  "collectall extant films of austens work you can skip this one  	0
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1
it is not good  	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
this is a stunning movie  	1
raw and sublimely moving  	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from  people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
all of the  players are mesmerising  	1
tom wilkinson broke   at the end and  elses  by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
hes a national treasure  	1
go and see it  	1
this is an excellent film  	1
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
it was also the right balance of war and love  	1
the film gives meaning to the phrase "never in the history of human conflict has so much  owed by so many to so few  	1
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a   	1
a good film by a great director  	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen  at family relationships and marriage  	1
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	0
this is just a great movie  	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection  	0
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary  watkins creates a film like no other  	1
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1

you wont regret it  	1
highly recommended a+  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
its a case of so bad it is laughable  	0
 very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at  all the time  	0
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  	0
how awful  is  	0
but  is still a bad actress repeating  robotic face moves in each of  pictures  	0
the results well are a shame  	0
delete this film from your mind  	0
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
the show would begin with smart ass ed  to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors  	0
never  of any of them except  who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0
every time  opened his mouth you expect to ar "you see kidspulling t plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
 and  are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character  	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is  	0
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong  	0

a lassie movie which should have  "put to sleep" forever  	0
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film  	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen  	0
it isnt even an  as a "sobaditsgoodor "sobaditsmemorablemovie  	0
its an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on  	0
avoid avoid avoid  	0
it will drive you barking mad  	0
the transfers are very good  	1
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	1
the movie is  of wonderful dancing  the title  	1
  great music and terrific scenery  	1
it handles   issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
 a happy wonderful  good ending  	1
the point is the journey a journey that  every member of the family  	1
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it  on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
nothing new there  	0
that was done in the second movie  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
what on earth is irons  in this film  	0
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	1
it has a very good plot it holds your complete  the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for t ordeal that is about to begin but   t matter in hand as t story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you  t characters anguish and suffering  	1
emily watsons character is very strong and  has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  	1
 the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises   	1
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling  first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
im a big fan of this series mostly  to anne rices  sensitivities and treatments  	1
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
meredith m was better than all right  	1
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and   	1
it is  when a   the time to  a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the  of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
nine out of  for a truly lovely film  	1
this early film from  goremeister lucio  is a very good  to the giallo subgenre  	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s  	1
a standout scene  	1
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied  vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill  	1
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	1
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was  to do just about everything to stay with his son  	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
and it was boring  	0
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in  and fast  	0
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the  character finds  room  up  	1
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  	1
an italian reviewer called this "a small great filmand thats right  	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events  is part of to the cool star  	1
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself  	1
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with  by the "acting coachare fascinating  	1
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever   	1
you wont  this movie  	1
why was this film made  	0
the film has an ultracheap look to it  	0
the  is a film that just dont look right  	0
none of them are  or exciting  	0
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was "the strangerand i loved it  	1
but t duet between t astronaut and his doctor at t beginning of t movie is a perfect  if one considers that this movie was made well into t cold war and t astronauts biggest fear is that  has crasd in t ussr  	1
this movie is so awesome  	1
i loved it it was really scary  	1
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
if you want a real scare  this one  	1
10/10  	1
this is an extraordinary film  	1
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the  justice system its frightening  	1
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court  	1
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen  	1
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a  from the fine performance by   	1
predictable but not a bad watch  	1
it was clear that  had the range and ability to pull off this part  	1
 carries the movie well  	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd  	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong  	0
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
avoid at all costs  	0
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
t acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and wasd out and  tm seem as old as ty look in real life t special effects are tacky like wn spock has to rescue kirk on a jet  wn  falls down from a mountain  	0
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent  thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
the worst one of the series  	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in  opinion  	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better  as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
this film offers many delights and surprises  	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from "don giovannithat perfectly describes their  in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
the story unfolds in 18th  jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
you  general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just  a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
the  it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch  	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors  their  scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and   	1
angus scrimm also  in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
conclusion  i loved it  	1
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1
i  to find anything bad to say about it  	1
mark  words this is one of those cult films like evil  2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
its pretty  that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as  generally had its collective  in the  concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it  to white   	1
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast  time it does an amazing job  	1
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a  black man who is  of murdering a white man in the south  	1
trumbull on i love   	1
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up  amazing dialog about how far race  have come in the last 50 years  	1
see both films if you can  	1
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella "the   	1
feelings thoughtsgabriels  during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal  	1
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
its very slow  	0
lot of holes in t plot tres nothing about how  became t emperor; nothing about wre  spend 20 years between his  and  age  	0
 dont waste your time  	0
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen  	0
 surely doesnt know how to make a corent action movie from t screenwriter of  force one who was only obliged to write t script just for a big sum of money  	0
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
im still trying to get over how bad it was  	0
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	1
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy  subplots native  brain eating if youre  for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
its like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
everything stinks  	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story  and so on  	0
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	0
in short dont bother with this movie  	0
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the  is a powerhouse  made more timely now  because of our cultures  fascination with celebrity and its  interpretations of fame  	1
a film not easily forgotten  	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because  is a great actor  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate  of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
great movie  	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the  film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt  	0
either way it sucks  	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
then theres the plot holes  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
shes poised and amazing  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
 cant act one of t least scary villains i have ever seen  cant write did  write this damn movie in his sleep  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the  sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in   life  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and  should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet   flicks  	0
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	0
there arent death scenes like in  movies and the f/x are terrible  	0
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs  	0
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
the best part about "nurse bettyis its unpredictability  	1
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from  and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never  what is going to happen next  	1
otherwise dont even waste your time on this  	0
this one just fails to  any real suspense  	0
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
there is however  pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone  	0
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen  	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
hated it  	0
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad  	0
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie  	0
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash  	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
the acting is like  wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is  	0
so i am here to warn youdo not  this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen  	0
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it  	1
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
excellent short film  	1
 the director james cox can turn the short into a  length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
the story line is totally predictable  	0
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
really awful  	0
not easy to watch  	0
funny clever hip  just like prays  film   	1
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has  one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie  	1
i rate this movie 9/10  	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs  debut but the  the interplay and development of the characters as well as  clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all  a natural eye  	1
the interplay between martin and emilio  the same wonderful  we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	1
kathy bates is wonderful in  characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on  character in "at play in the fields of the lord"  	1
for  who have already seen one of miyazakis films  is still in top form and made anotr worthwhile experience  	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine  and believable problems  	1
the two  characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy  arts  	1
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful  	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
people who like european films and "art movieswill like this movie  	1
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
go  it  	1
however after finally  this film i realized that not only had i had a  mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself  it over and over again  	1
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to  to decipher its meanings  	1
brilliance indeed  	1
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you  	1
think of the film being like a dream  	1
simply beautiful  	1
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
just whatever you do avoid "grooveas its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
its too bad that  else involved didnt  crowes level of  to quality for if they did  have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the  of the "gadget"  	1
i enjoyed it  	1
i have recommended it to   	1
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz  	1
both actors truly understand and become their particular character  a convincing sincere performance  	1
their onscreen  critical to the  film is genuine  	1
the films dialogue is natural real to life  	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1
definitely worth seeing¬Ö its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
hayao miyazakis  and eighth film for  ghibili "gake no ue no ponyoponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at   	1
at a time when it seems that film animation has  dominated by disney/pixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on  handdrawn animation to  his charming and enchanting stories  	1
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	1
the art  has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful  	1
if you act in  a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	0
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  	1
 we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting  	0

still its quite interesting and entertaining to   	1
; recommend with confidence  	1
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1

i have used  phone in two years but this one is the best	1

att is not clear sound is very  and you have to yell when you talk	0
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
price is good too	1
dont make the same mistake i did	0
oh and i  to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine	1
also the area where  unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap	0
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all  appointments and contacts in and gets great reception	1
every thing on phone work perfectly  like it	1
another  about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
its really easy	1
 sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without  effect	1
fantastic earphones	1
it finds  cell phone right away when i  the car	1
low quality	0
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before	1
warning  stay away	0
i wish i could return the unit and get back  money	0
awsome device works great	1
i used to talk on it for 1  1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit  with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
very displeased	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the  quality alone	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to 	0

i searched the  and found this one to be the best value	1
does not 	0
very happy with this product	1
the screen  is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone	1

 colleague & i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great	1

the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
disappointment i hate anything that goes in  ear	0
great software for 	1
the  was on time	1
very easy to use	1
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with  vx9900 env	0
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
id like to return it	0
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems	1
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
you wont regret it	1
i love this phone	1
a disappointment	0
its not user friendly	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important  and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
then i  for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute	0
this pda rocks	1
it is super  up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone and excels in those roles	1
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are  for comfort clarity and a great price	1
i had  2 years ago and really liked their service	1
pretty piece of junk	0
plug was the wrong 	0
works as described	1
save your money ive had this  for 11 months now	0

defective crap	0

the holster that  did not match the photo in the ad	0
greatno problems at all	1
as an  review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye 	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right  of times for the  you want or not	0

i received   well within the shipping  everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source	1
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this  to anyone	0
 only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5	0
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price	1
i ended up sliding it on the edge of  pants or back pockets 	1
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
works great	1
really ugly	0
horrible had to switch 3 times	0
the noise shield is incrediable	1
no real improvement	0
razr battery  good buy	1
keep up the good work amazon	1
they refuse to refund or 	0
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
so i basically threw  money out the window for nothing	0
great case and price	1
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left  phone in the trunk got a call and carried the  without a hitch	1
small sleek impressive  practical setup with ample  in place	1
the eargels  the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
i am glad i purchased it	1
ive   calls because of this reason	0
  phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
dont buy this product	0
sucked most of the stuff does not work with  phone	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with  new one for the droid	1
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
i love the camera its really pretty good quality	1
 you for  great service	1
its a total package	1
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again	1
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingular/at&t; and inform them of this practice	0
its aggravating	0
great product for the price	1
i have purchased these for both family and  and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone	1
none of it works just dont buy it	0
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
please dont waste your money	0
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase	1
if you are  for a good quality motorola headset keep  this isnt it	0
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
disapointing results	0
cumbersome design	0
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected	1
great product	1
its a piece of crap	0
 experience was terrible this was  fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than  last jabra which i hated	0
this fixes all the problems	1
worst ever	0
i am very happy	1
ive had no trouble accessing the  downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions	1
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what"	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
that company is a joke	0
it does everything the description said it would	1
 to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
 tech support walked  through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all  data	0
voice quality signal strength dropped calls	0
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not	1
better than expected	1
it feels poorly constructed the  are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
battery is holding up well	1
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product	0
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with	0
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking	0
sprint  terrible customer service	0
linked to  phone without effort	1
they are so cool	1
easy to use	1
better than new	1
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
piece of trash	0
a pretty good product	1
this is a great phone	1
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend	1
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre 	1
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
i am more than happy with this product	1
poor construction	0
this is infuriating	0
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
sprint charges for this service	0
it is cheap and it  and look just as cheap	0
it fits  ear well and is comfortable on	1
it doesnt work in europe or asia	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you  like 50 cents upandcoming	1
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear  and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original  cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price	1
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging  phone	0
poor product	0
however i needed  better instructions	0
you need two hands to  the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
worked very well paired with a  700w and as a skype headset on  pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
all the other cases ive tried  fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
very dissapointing performance	0
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone	0
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any 	0
case was more or less an  that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched  ear	0
i recommend igo to anyone with different  cell phones/mp3 players in the family	1
dont bother  go to the store	0
i posted more detailed  under the grey or black phone but i have the fire  and its a great color	1
i did not have any problem with this  and would order it again if needed	1
you get what you pay for i guess	0
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make  own ringtones form  existing cds without an  connection	1
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much  about it	1
these are fabulous	1
however bt  are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0
 awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
very windresistant	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to  and the sound is much better than others i have tried	1
i contacted the company and they  me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce  receipt i was out of luck	0
linksys should have  way to  a bad phone for a refurb unit or thing	0
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are	1
great phone	1
when i placed   into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of  room on the sides	0
im pleased	1
battery is terrible	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of  ear	0
utter crap sound quality is terrible	0
the charger  within the promised  but it did not work	0
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great	1
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the  rebootsoverall i still rate this device 	1
talk about useless customer service	0
it felt too light and "tinny"	0
this does not  the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
i love the look and  of samsung flipphones	1
its welldesigned and very sharp  the blue is a very nice color	1
does everything it should and more	1
i could not recommend these more	0
nice sound	1
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment	0
much less than the jawbone i was going to  it with	1
setup went very smoothly	1
its extremely slow and  forever to do anything with it	0
a must  for anyone interested in the "worst sinsof industrial design	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
it is well made easy to  the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
cant upload ringtones from a third party	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just  up and now it just makes calls randomly while in  pocket locked	0
truly awful	0
it works fine on  motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did	1
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
and none of the tones is acceptable	0
camera color balance is awful	0
this product is clearly not  for  time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant  a call is coming in its worthless	0
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
 forgeries abound	0
easy to pair with  samsung cell	1
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
i would  to not purchase this  it never worked very well	0
too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a  for the service	0
works well	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with  phone	0
clear crisp sound	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast	0
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in  ear	0
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
it doesnt make you look cool	0
because both ears are occupied  is not distracting at all	1
comfortable   you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an  day	1
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player	0
you cant beat the price on these	1
*  with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even  sos signals seriously	1
lightweight and works well	1
so just beware	0
i love this cable  it  me to connect any miniusb device to  pc	1
so anyone near you will hear part of your 	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there  the screen to get all scratched up	1
i bought this phone as a replacement for  startac and have regretted it since	0
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with  v325i	1
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim	0
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy  has the same phone with the same problem	0
poor quality	0
jabra ear  "rthe best	1
not worth it	0
the phone  completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
it  working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned	1
unfortunately it will not recharge  iphone 4s  connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0
it was a great phone	1
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the  bells & whistles are mediocre	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
 phone doesnt slide around  car now and the grip prevents  phone from slipping out of  hand	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last  phone for me	0
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim "whoa  is that the new phone on tv	1
i have always used corded  and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows  of wear it is 100% functional	1
other than that the leather is nice and soft; the  is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape	1
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more	1
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke	0
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
none of the three  they sent with the headset would stay in  ears	0
 has the best customer service anywhere	1
 quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months 	0
provides good protection and looks classy too	1
krussel always good	1
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
the design is very good4	1
i great reception all the time	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
it dit not work most of the time with  nokia 5320	0
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after 	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever  next phone is	1
stay away from this store be careful	0
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome	1
does not 	0
   quickly and works great with  metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs	1
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time	1
disappointing	0
blue ant is easy to use	1
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised  the low cost of this 	1
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this	0
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
its very convenient and simple to use  gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother	1
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0
the sound quality is excellent as well	1
its the best headset i have used	1

they have  around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen  that i have found to date	1
just what i wanted	1
this particular model would not work with  motorola q smartphone	0
wont work right or atleast for me	0
in  it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic	0
but now that it is "out of warrantythe same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good	0
great product	1
crisp and clear	1
after the first charge kept going  after 12 minutes	0
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor	0
i get absolutely horrible reception in  apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
the reception has  generally good	1
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
great bluetooth	1
i highly recommend this case	1

this is a great deal	1
after  phone got to be about a year old its  slowly breaking  much care on  part	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
i bought these hoping i could make  bluetooth headset  better but these things made it impossible to wear	0
 and  refused to  it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade 	0
it was horrible	0
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
this  the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
it is simple to use and i like it	1
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results	1
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting	0
